/**
It seems that, when the input is a DayPicker, Bootstrap does not update the property `display: none` of the
`invalid-feedback` div when it should. `FormControl.Feedback` is thus never displayed.
As we only display (in the React code) the Feedback when it's not empty, we just always override the display property.
