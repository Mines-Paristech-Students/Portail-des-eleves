 * be automatically be wrapped in an `AssociationLayout`, which includes a sidebar
 * by default. If it's `false` it will not.
 * You may want to take advantage of it if :
 * - you want a custom sidebar, in that case you'll wrap your component with
 * `AssociationLayout` manually
 * - you don't want a sidebar at all, in that case you can organise your code as
