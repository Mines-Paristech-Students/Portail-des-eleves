"""
The repartition algorithm is based on Munkres algorithm, or "Hungarian" algorithm, which, given a cost matrix, 
returns a pairing between lines and columns that minimises the cost.

The implementation we use here is lapsolver's
https://github.com/cheind/py-lapsolver

However it does more than simply calling Munkres algorithm because we have two additional constraints : 
- we have  "categories" of users ie subsets that have to be mixed inside of each group. For instance if we have 10 users
"A" and 10 users "B" to split into two groups we want to have twice "5 A  + 5 B" instead of one group of all As and one
group of all Bs
- we want groups to be "even" ie we don't want to be more than 1 person of difference between two groups (ex : one group
of 15 people and another of 5 people) nor inside of a group between categories (ex: 2A and 8B in one group and 8A and 2B
 in the other)

To abide by theses constraints, the algorithm is split in 2 stages:
(1) make an even repartition for a category
    determine the number of place necessary for each group
        - if there are n people and m groups, we'll have k places in each group were (k-1) * m < n <= k * m
    
    create the cost matrix
        - one line by user
        - one column per place in group, each column corresponding to one group is identical
        - example : 3 users, and 2 groups => k = 4
            (1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 2) 
            (2, 1) (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 2)
            (3, 1) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 2)
    
    run hungarian algorithm
    
    if there are too many people in one or several group, add a "penalty" to the group which has the most people. This
    is as if one place was removed in this group so on the next iteration it'll have one less person
    
    rerun the algorithm as long as the repartition isn't even
    
(2)  make the repartition even among categories
    repeat step (1) for each category but adding a penalty on each run corresponding to how many people each group has
    more in cumulated (either 0 or 1)
