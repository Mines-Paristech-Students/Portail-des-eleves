"""
Related to filter must be used in DRF views to check that a tag has been assigned to at least one object of a certain
type. For instance if "my_tag" is related to a Media but to no Product, /tags/tags?related_to=media must return my_tag
but /tags/tags?related_to=product must not.
It's possible to check multiple classes using commas. Example : /tags/tags?related_to=tag,product would return all tags
related to at least one Tag or one Product
